# Public Charging Infrastructure in Germany: Data Analysis & Dashboard

This project is an interactive dashboard application that visualizes the current state of public charging infrastructure in Germany. It was developed as a take-home task for a data analyst position at NOW GmbH.

## Data Used

This project utilizes three main datasets:

1.  **Charging Infrastructure Data:** Cleaned data from the Federal Network Agency's charging station register, provided by the National Control Centre for Charging Infrastructure at NOW GmbH. The raw data can be downloaded from the public data platform Mobilithek:
    * **Data Source Link:** https://mobilithek.info/offers/842113170303512576
    * **`ladestationFactTable.csv`**: Contains metadata on charging stations, such as geographical coordinates, operator information, and addresses.
    * **`ladepunktFactTable.csv`**: Contains technical details for individual charging points, including charging power and connector types.

2.  **Geospatial Data:** A Shapefile (`VG250_KRS.shp`) from the Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy (BKG). This data was used to visualize the German district boundaries and spatially join the charging infrastructure data for a map-based analysis.

## What Was Done

1.  **Data Integration:** The provided CSV files were processed and merged using Python and Pandas, joining them on a common `ladestation_id`.
2.  **Geospatial Join:** The aggregated charging infrastructure data was joined with the district boundary data to enable a visual representation of charging station density on a map.
3.  **Dashboard Development:** An interactive dashboard was built using Streamlit and Plotly. It allows users to visualize the charging infrastructure at the district level and apply filters (e.g., by state or charging type).

## Project Structure

The project follows a clear and professional folder structure for organization and reproducibility:

## How to Run the Project

To run the dashboard locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Charging_Infrastructure_in_Germany.git`
    `cd Charging_Infrastructure_in_Germany`

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    `python3 -m venv venv`
    * **macOS / Linux:** `source venv/bin/activate`
    * **Windows:** `venv\Scripts\activate`

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4.  **Start the dashboard:**
    `streamlit run 01_app/dashboard_no_map.py`
